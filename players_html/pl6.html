      <div class="accordion-body"><p>Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz (American Spanish: [ˈlwis ˈswaɾes]; born 24 January 1987) is a Uruguayan professional footballer who plays as a striker for Spanish club Atlético Madrid and the Uruguay national team. Nicknamed El Pistolero ('The Gunman'),[2] he is known for his passing, finishing and comfort with the ball. Suárez is regarded as one of the best players of his generation and one of the greatest strikers of all time.[note 1] Suárez has won two European Golden Shoes, an Eredivisie Golden Boot, a Premier League Golden Boot, and the Pichichi Trophy. He has scored over 500 career goals for club and country.</p></div>

      <div class="accordion-body"><strong><h4>Ajax </h4><br></strong><p>On 9 August 2007 Suárez signed a five-year contract with Ajax, for a transfer fee of €7.5 million,[36][38] and made his club debut in the UEFA Champions League qualifier against Slavia Prague.[39] He scored one goal in his Eredivisie debut for the club[40] and two goals in his home debut at the Amsterdam Arena.[41] Ajax finished second in the league table in the 2007–08 season[42] and Suárez scored 17 goals in 33 league appearances, setting up a blossoming striking partnership with league top scorer Klaas-Jan Huntelaar </p>

<strong><br>Liverpool<br></strong><p>During the suspension, Ajax were in contact with other European clubs interested in Suárez. On 28 January 2011, they accepted a €26.5 million (£22.8 million) offer for Suárez from Premier League club Liverpool.[65][66][67] Despite leaving while suspended, Suárez departed Ajax on good terms, and he was given a farewell sendoff after an Ajax match. </p>

<strong><br><h4>Barcelona</h4><br></strong><p>On 11 July 2014, Suárez agreed with Barcelona on a five-year contract for an undisclosed transfer fee.[149] However, according to a leaked document by Football Leaks, the fee was £64.98 million (€82.3 million), making him one of the most expensive players in world football history.[7][150] Barça confirmed Suárez would wear the number 9 shirt for the 2014–15 season. Suárez missed the first part of the season after being found guilty of biting Italian player Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[152][153] As part of the suspension, he was banned from all "football-related activities", including training for Barcelona, for four months (until 26 October). He was also banned from entering any stadium, even as a spectator, during the same period.</p>
